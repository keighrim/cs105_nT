## ROUTES
**due: 10/16/2015**

We need at least three landing pages in `main-app.rb`.
* [ ] `/`
* [ ] `/login`
* [ ] `/user/name`

To discuss: additionaly we can have arbitrary pages for internal redirections between services.
(Let's not worry about REST APIs right now.)

## HTMLUI
**due: 10/16/2015**

Need to design these pages

1. non-logged in `/` 
    * [ ] general timeline
    * [ ] login button
    * [ ] ready for camera?
1. logged in `/`
    * [ ] personal timeline
    * [ ] ready for camera?
1. profile pages (`user/name`) common (shown to non-logged-in's)
    * [ ] profile
    * [ ] list of followes
    * [ ] single user timeline
    * [ ] ready for camera?
1. owner's profile page
    * [ ] same as `logged-in-/`
1. visitor's profile page
    * [ ] follow button
    * [ ] ready for camera?

## nT-0.1
